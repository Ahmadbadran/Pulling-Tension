# Pulling-Tension
Tension Calculator


This program seems to be a tension calculator for cables and ducts. It prompts the user to input several variables such as weight, outside diameter of the cable, inside diameter of the duct, coefficient of friction, and maximum tension of the pulled item.

The user is then prompted to choose between pulling a duct or a cable, and whether the existing duct is empty or occupied. Depending on the user's choices, the program proceeds to calculate the tension of a straight or curved line, using different equations and formulas.

Finally, the program checks whether the total tension is less than the maximum tension of the pulled item, and prints out a message to either allow or disallow the installation of the cable or duct, respectively.
